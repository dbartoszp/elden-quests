<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

Passion project for Elden Ring, mostly done for fun but also in order to learn some more web development.

Having struggled with questlines in Elden Ring I decided to make a webproject just for that - compiling every NPC with a questline and showing how to solve them step by step.
You will be able to search for, or browse all NPCs, sorted alphabetically and by location (first appearance).
