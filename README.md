# Elden-Quests
<!-- ELDEN-QUESTS -->

Passion project for Elden Ring, mostly done for fun but also in order to learn some more web development.

Having struggled with questlines in Elden Ring I decided to make a webproject just for that - compiling every NPC with a questline and showing how to solve them step by step.
You will be able to search for, or browse all NPCs, sorted alphabetically and by location (first appearance).

<!-- BUILT WITH -->
Project will be done using HTML, SCSS, JS and probably NestJS for backend.
