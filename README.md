# Elden-Quests
<!-- ELDEN-QUESTS -->

Passion project for Elden Ring, mostly done for fun but also in order to learn some more web development.

Having struggled with questlines in Elden Ring I decided to make a webproject just for that - compiling every NPC with a questline and showing how to solve them step by step.
You will be able to search for, or browse all NPCs, sorted alphabetically and by location (first appearance).

Project will be done using HTML, SCSS, JS and probably NestJS for backend.
